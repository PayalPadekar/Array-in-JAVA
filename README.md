# Array-in-JAVA
An array in Java is a data structure that stores a fixed-size sequential collection of elements of the same data type. It allows you to group related data together and access elements using their index, which starts from 0. Arrays are widely used in Java for tasks like storing and processing collections of data efficiently.
